Description
This plugin adds a "Daily" column to the PowerTeacher "Record Meeting Attendance" screen which displays the current daily attendance code for the students.  Even if staff are able to set Meeting attendance for previous days, the Daily Code will still reflect the attendance on the current calendar day (not previous).

The code was originally based on Brian Sizer's "Class Attendance with inline daily attendance display" customization, though reworked to link lookup students based on ccid values rather than names.
