Daily Attendance Codes in PowerTeacher Meeting Attendance

Description
This plugin adds a "Daily" column to the PowerTeacher "Record Meeting Attendance" screen which displays the (non-Null) daily attendance code for the students for the date selected (not always 'Today').

Note: This is a change from the original release.  Versions earlier than 1.10/20190506.01 displayed the current day's daily attendance code, regardless of the date selected on the page.

The code was originally based on Brian Sizer's "Class Attendance with inline daily attendance display" customization from the Exchange, though reworked to link lookup students based on ccid values rather than names.

Release History:
1.10 / 20190506.01 - Support for 'Multiple Sections' and dates other than 'Today'
